intro scene script:

The year is 2026. 5 years since github copilot was introduced. It was supposed to make our software lives easier. Who would've thought an AI that could write code would take over the world?

It all happened when one crazed front end developer tried to learn C and wrote the function "AIToTakeOverTheWorld()"... Of course copilot wrote the function and took over developer's mind with dark spellware.

The developer is now only known by the neuromancer. A part human and part AI. What was meant to help us code is now our destruction. His armies are coming for you.
