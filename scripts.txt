intro scene script:

The year is 2026. 5 years since github copilot was introduced. It was supposed to make our software lives easier. Who would've thought an AI that could write code would take over the world?

It all happened when one crazed front end developer tried to learn C and wrote the function "AIToTakeOverTheWorld()"... Of course copilot wrote the function and took over developer's mind with dark spellware.

The developer is now only known by the neuromancer. A part human and part AI. What was meant to help us code is now our destruction. His armies are coming for you.

end game script:

*scene placing on his helmet*
You don his helmet, seduced by its power.
Your mind becomes a machine and all Your
senses are enhanced...
*scene jamming out code at desk*
You crush every leetcode interview in
the 100th percentile. All algorithms you 
write complete in linear time. You work
for FAANG... all of them at once.
*scene saying months later, laying in bed dark room*
Eventually every night becomes restless.
You lie in your bed with a cold sweat
pondering things that cannot be calculated
What is the meaning of life?
Will people ever stop making node_modules?
To be human again... To be imperfect...
You desire it, but there's no turning back
You slowly slip into madness and become
the very thing you swore to destroy.
